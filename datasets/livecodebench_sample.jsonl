{"id": "lcb-codeforces-gifts", "prompt": "You are an expert competitive programming assistant. Write a correct and efficient Python program that solves the problem. Read input from standard input and write the required output to standard output.\n\nYou have $n$ gifts and you want to give all of them to children. Of course, you don't want to offend anyone, so all gifts should be equal between each other. The $i$-th gift consists of $a_i$ candies and $b_i$ oranges.\n\nDuring one move, you can choose some gift $1 \\le i \\le n$ and do one of the following operations:\n\n  eat exactly one candy from this gift (decrease $a_i$ by one);  eat exactly one orange from this gift (decrease $b_i$ by one);  eat exactly one candy and exactly one orange from this gift (decrease both $a_i$ and $b_i$ by one). \n\nOf course, you can not eat a candy or orange if it's not present in the gift (so neither $a_i$ nor $b_i$ can become less than zero).\n\nAs said above, all gifts should be equal. This means that after some sequence of moves the following two conditions should be satisfied: $a_1 = a_2 = \\dots = a_n$ and $b_1 = b_2 = \\dots = b_n$ (and $a_i$ equals $b_i$ is not necessary).\n\nYour task is to find the minimum number of moves required to equalize all the given gifts.\n\nYou have to answer $t$ independent test cases.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$) — the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of the test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 50$) — the number of gifts. The second line of the test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$), where $a_i$ is the number of candies in the $i$-th gift. The third line of the test case contains $n$ integers $b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$ ($1 \\le b_i \\le 10^9$), where $b_i$ is the number of oranges in the $i$-th gift.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print one integer: the minimum number of moves required to equalize all the given gifts.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n5\n3\n3 5 6\n3 2 3\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n5 4 3 2 1\n3\n1 1 1\n2 2 2\n6\n1 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n3\n10 12 8\n7 5 4\n\nOutput\n6\n16\n0\n4999999995\n7\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case of the example, we can perform the following sequence of moves:\n\n  choose the first gift and eat one orange from it, so $a = [3, 5, 6]$ and $b = [2, 2, 3]$;  choose the second gift and eat one candy from it, so $a = [3, 4, 6]$ and $b = [2, 2, 3]$;  choose the second gift and eat one candy from it, so $a = [3, 3, 6]$ and $b = [2, 2, 3]$;  choose the third gift and eat one candy and one orange from it, so $a = [3, 3, 5]$ and $b = [2, 2, 2]$;  choose the third gift and eat one candy from it, so $a = [3, 3, 4]$ and $b = [2, 2, 2]$;  choose the third gift and eat one candy from it, so $a = [3, 3, 3]$ and $b = [2, 2, 2]$.\n\nReturn only the Python code inside a single code block.", "language": "python", "metadata": {"source": "LiveCodeBench", "platform": "codeforces", "example_index": 0, "prompt_template": "stdin_problem"}}
